  <p>Captain Morrigan Quicksilver is the pirate alias of Mark Heimann, who runs a small pottery studio in Oregon known as <a href="/portfolio/lostmountain">Lost Mountain Clayworks</a>. Mark was interested in starring in Mark Burnett's <em>Pirate Master</em> reality show, so we put together a short audition film that details a few facets of his eclectic personality. Indeed, his video includes flintlock pistol-firing, axe-throwing, and even a bit of pottery. We shot the film in a day, edited it that evening, and overnighted the DVD the following morning.</p>
